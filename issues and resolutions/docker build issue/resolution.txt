We need to add FZ root certificate in the build container's CA certs. To do that, take following steps:


1) Open any public internet site, or "https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" in browser

2) Export the root certificate (the first one in certificate chain) and save it somewhere under the folder which will be used for docker context to build the image.
for example save alongside source code as "certs/fz-root-ca.crt"

3) Then add the following statements in docker file before "dotnet restore" to copy the certificate in the build container, and install it in the CA

# Copy NuGet's root certificate
COPY ["certs/fz-root-ca.crt", "/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/fz-root-cert.crt"]

# Install and update CA certificates
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y ca-certificates && \
    update-ca-certificates
