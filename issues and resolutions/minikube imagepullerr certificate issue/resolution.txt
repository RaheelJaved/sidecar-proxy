"minikube start" command spins up a docker container where single node cluster of kubernetes runs.
We need to add FZ root certificate in that container. Minikube has a way to automatically do that

take following steps

1) Find the MINIKUBE_HOME. By default it creates the home in the folder from where we do "minikube start"
otherwise we can defaine a "MINIKUBE_HOME" environment variable, and point it to the folder which we want to be minikube home
so... create a folder, for example "C:\MINIKUBE_HOME" and set the environment variable MINIKUBE_HOME=C:\MINIKUBE_HOME

2) Inside the MINIKUBE_HOME create new folder ".minikube/certs"

3) Copy the certificate file in ".minikube/certs" folder

4) Delete minikube cluster if its already running
$ minikube delete

5) Start new cluster with the certificate 
$ minikube start --embed-certs
